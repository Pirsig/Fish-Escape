# Fish-Escape
Just something I made a couple years ago to get a better handle on working with unity and take something from start to finish.  It's a flappy bird clone thing where you also collect other fish to help them escape.  (I really should have put like a big shark mouth or something on the left that's always coming after you, but oh well XD)

Don't expect to find anything too amazing here, but I figured there's no reason to not just make it open in case anyone ever wants to mess with it on their own journey to figure out Unity and Game Dev.  This is all presented as is, I haven't looked at this original code in ~two years at this point other than to reference how I did certain things.  Definitely not with any sort of eye towards refactoring or applying new knowledge.  

Also note that it uses BinaryFormatter which is obsolete now due to security issues.

Maybe I'll upload a build at some point if I feel the urge, but for now if you want to actually play it you'd have to create a new project, add this to it, and then it ***should*** work.  I haven't tested this myself at the time of making this public though.  The last version I viewed the project in was 2019.4.17, but I believe the last time I built it was still a 2018 LTS version of Unity.

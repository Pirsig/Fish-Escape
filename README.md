# Fish-Escape
Just something I made a couple years ago to get a better handle on working with unity and take something from start to finish.  It's a flappy bird clone thing where you also collect other fish to help them escape.  (I really should have put like a big shark mouth or something on the left that's always coming after you, but oh well XD)

Don't expect to find anything too amazing here, but I figured there's no reason to not just make it open in case anyone ever wants to mess with it on their own journey to figure out Unity and Game Dev.
